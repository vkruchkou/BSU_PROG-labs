Language Basics Tasks: This includes understanding basic language constructs such as variables, data types, operators, loops, conditional operators, and functions. For example, writing a program to solve a quadratic equation or a program to sort an array.

Tasks for understanding memory: This includes working with dynamic memory, pointers, and references. For example, writing a program to implement data structures such as linked lists or binary trees.

Tasks for object-oriented programming: This includes understanding classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. For example, writing a program to simulate a library system or a banking system.

File and I/O tasks: This includes reading and writing files, and handling I/O errors. For example, writing a program to copy files or read and analyze data from a text file.

Tasks for algorithms and data structures: This includes the study and implementation of various algorithms and data structures such as search, sorting, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.

Also working with assembler and developing a windowed application on WINAPI.
